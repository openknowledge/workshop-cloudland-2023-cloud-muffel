# 4 – Lambda

In this exercise we use AWS Lambda to add additional functionality to our application without chaning any existing backend code. We want to sent an "email" whenever a new topic is added to our forum. To do this we use any DynamoDB change in our table as trigger for our Lambda function.

1. Create a new Lambda function

    - Go to the Lambda page in the AWS Management console
    - Click on "Create Function"
    - Select "Author from Scratch" and use Node.js as runtime
    - Name it after your user
    - Under permissions choose "Use existing role" and select the role "Lambda"
    - Create the function

2. Add DynamoDB changes as trigger for our Lambda function

    - Click on "Add Trigger" and select DynamoDB as source
    - Select the table you created in exercise `3_paas`
    - Create the trigger

3. Change the code

    - Use `console.log` to print the event to console
    - Click on deploy to change the function

4. Connect the frontend to AppRunner service

    - Adjust the showcase "4 – Lambda" in showcases.ts
    - Set the base URL using the default domain of your app runner service
    - Select showcase "4 – Lambda" and check if the app works properly

5. Create a new topic using the frontend

6. Check if your Lambda was invoked

    - On the Lambda management page click on the "Monitor" tab
    - Click on "View CloudWatch logs"
    - Try to find the output of you `console.log`

7. Play around a with Lambda and DynamoDB

    - Inspect the event further and try to extract things like the topic name
    - Print the important information
